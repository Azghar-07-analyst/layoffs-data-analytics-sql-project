# Global Layoffs Data Analysis using SQL

## Project Overview
This project analyzes global tech layoffs data using SQL. The goal was to clean raw data and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends related to companies, industries, funding, and time periods.


## Data Cleaning
The following steps were performed:

1. Removed duplicate records using window functions  
2. Standardized company names, industries, and country fields  
3. Converted date formats  
4. Handled missing and null values  
5. Removed unnecessary helper columns  

All cleaning steps were done using SQL in MySQL.


## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
After cleaning, several analytical queries were executed to explore:

- Total layoffs by company and industry  
- Companies with 100% layoffs  
- Layoffs trend over time  
- Layoffs by country  
- Relationship between funding and layoffs  

These queries help identify which sectors and companies were most affected.


## Tools Used
- MySQL  
- SQL (Window functions, CTEs, Aggregations)


## Key Insights
The main findings from the analysis are documented in a separate file:
`insights.md` contains summarized business insights derived from the SQL analysis.


## Files in This Repository
- `data_cleaning.sql` - Contains all SQL queries used for cleaning the dataset  
- `eda.sql` - Contains all SQL queries used for exploratory data analysis
- `insights.md` - Key insights and conclusions from the analysis  


## Key Skills Demonstrated
- SQL (CTEs, Joins, Aggregations, Window Functions)  
- Data Cleaning & Standardization  
- Exploratory Data Analysis
